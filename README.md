    b.  Inspect the R object [`cmpdata.RData`] from the `lecures/week02` folder.  What makes this data non-tidy?

2.  **Reshaping simple examples in R.**

    a.  In R, replicate the reshaped object `cmpdataLong` from the lecture notes, using the **reshape2** package.  (Just use the same syntax as in the lecture notes.)

    b.  Try using **dplyr** on `cmpdataLong` to "spread" this back into the wide format.

3.  **Reshaping more complex examples in Python**.


4.  **Reshaping more complex examples in R**.
