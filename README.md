1.  **Identifying the characteristics of "tidy" data.**

    a.  What makes the following example "non-tidy"?

    b.  Inspect the R object [`cmpdata.RData`] from the `lecures/week02` folder.  What makes this data non-tidy?

2.  **Reshaping simple examples in R.**

    a.  In R, replicate the reshaped object `cmpdataLong` from the lecture notes, using the **reshape2** package.  (Just use the same syntax as in the lecture notes.)

    b.  Try using **dplyr** on `cmpdataLong` to "spread" this back into the wide format.

3.  **Reshaping more complex examples in Python.**

    a. Take a look of the [assignment-2-complex-example-python.ipynb](assignment-2-complex-example-python.ipynb) and understand the code.
    
    b. Try to play with the code and make some changes.

4.  **Reshaping more complex examples in R.**

    a. Try to reshape the data by yourself! Update the [assignment-2-complex-example-r.ipynb](assignment-2-complex-example-r.ipynb) to reshape the same dataset we used in (3). But this time we will do it in R.
